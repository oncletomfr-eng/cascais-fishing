**Before any task execution:**
1. **Research**: Study complete documentation via context7 or relevant sources
2. **Implement**: Execute full solution in reality (no simulation/speculation)
3. **Test**: Verify functionality online via browsermcp or testing tools
4. **Report**: Only after verified testing completion

**Prohibited:**
- Speculation or invented data
- Simulation of functionality
- Assumptions without verification

**Testing Cycle:**
- Wait for ALL tests to complete
- Analyze all results
- Declare success ONLY after all tests pass
- Provide detailed execution report
