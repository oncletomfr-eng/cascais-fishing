Documentation Research and Real Implementation Rule
Core Requirements

Before proceeding with any individual task execution, you must:

    Study Complete Documentation: Research and study all necessary documentation for the given topic on context7 or relevant sources
    Full Implementation: Execute the task completely and comprehensively in reality
    Real-World Verification: All actions must be performed in reality and verified in reality
    Online Testing: Test the implementation and verify its correct operation online through browsermcp or appropriate testing tools

Prohibited Actions

    NO Speculation: Do not invent, imagine, or synthesize data
    NO Simulation: Do not simulate or imitate functionality
    NO Assumptions: Do not make assumptions about functionality without verification

Reporting Standards

You may only write a task completion report when you have:

    Actually tested the implementation in reality
    Verified the correct operation online through browsermcp
    Confirmed all functionality works as expected

Implementation Workflow

    Documentation Phase: Thoroughly research all relevant documentation
    Implementation Phase: Build/execute the complete solution
    Testing Phase: Test all functionality in real conditions
    Verification Phase: Confirm correct operation through online testing
    Reporting Phase: Document verified results only
