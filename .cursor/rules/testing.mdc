# Complete Testing Cycle Rule

## Description
This rule ensures that the AI assistant will wait for all tests to complete before declaring successful task execution.

## Application
- **Scope**: All project files (`**/*`)
- **Mode**: Always active (`alwaysApply: true`)

## Behavior
1. Run all necessary tests
2. Wait for complete testing cycle to finish
3. Analyze results of all tests
4. Only declare success after all tests pass successfully
5. Provide detailed execution report

## Notes
This rule prevents premature success declarations and ensures quality verification of work results.
