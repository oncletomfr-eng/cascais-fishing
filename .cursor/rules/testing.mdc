**Tag Strategy:**
- `master`: High-value deliverables, major milestones
- `feature-*`: Dedicated feature development
- `experiment-*`: Risky/experimental work
- `refactor-*`: Code improvement initiatives

**Migration:** Existing projects auto-migrate to `master` tag

**Commands support `--tag <name>` flag for context switching**

**Workflow Transitions:**
- Simple → Team-based: Separate contexts for collaboration
- Simple → PRD-driven: Comprehensive planning for major features
- Existing project → Strategic: Research-based improvement planning
