# Task ID: 17
# Title: Multi-Phase Chat Core System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement context-aware chat with preparation, active trip, and post-trip phases, including phase transitions and specialized interfaces
# Details:
Create three distinct chat phases (preparation, active, post-trip). Implement smooth phase transition handling. Build phase-specific UI and functionality. Add context preservation across phases. Include participant list with online status. Create phase-appropriate message templates. Build on existing MultiPhaseChatSystem.tsx (694 lines).
