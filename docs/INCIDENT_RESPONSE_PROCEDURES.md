# Incident Response Procedures - Cascais Fishing Platform

## Overview
This document defines incident response procedures for the Cascais Fishing platform to ensure rapid detection, response, and resolution of production issues.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### P1 - Critical (Response: Immediate)
- **Complete service outage** - Platform inaccessible to all users
- **Authentication system down** - Users cannot login
- **Data corruption or loss** - Database integrity compromised
- **Security breach** - Unauthorized access detected
- **Payment system failure** - Transaction processing blocked

#### P2 - High (Response: <15 minutes)
- **Significant feature degradation** - Core features partially broken
- **High error rates** - >5% error rate on critical endpoints
- **Performance degradation** - Response times >2 seconds
- **Stream Chat system issues** - Real-time communication broken
- **Email delivery failure** - Notification system down

#### P3 - Medium (Response: <1 hour)
- **Minor feature issues** - Non-critical features affected
- **Moderate performance issues** - Response times 500ms-2s
- **UI/UX problems** - Display issues not affecting functionality
- **Third-party integration delays** - Weather API, etc.

#### P4 - Low (Response: Next business day)
- **Cosmetic issues** - Visual inconsistencies
- **Documentation problems** - Incorrect or missing docs
- **Non-functional enhancements** - Performance optimizations

## Incident Detection

### Automated Monitoring
- **Vercel Alerts**: Build failures, deployment issues
- **Sentry Alerts**: Error rate spikes, critical errors
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Service availability checks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time degradation
- **Security Monitoring**: Suspicious activity detection

### Manual Reporting
- **User Reports**: Through support channels
- **Team Discovery**: During routine checks
- **Third-party Notifications**: From service providers

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)

#### P1 Critical Incidents
```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE alert immediately
2. Create incident in tracking system
3. Notify on-call engineer via phone/SMS
4. Begin triage and initial assessment
5. Communicate status to stakeholders
```

#### P2-P4 Incidents
```
1. Acknowledge alert within SLA timeframe
2. Create incident ticket
3. Assess scope and impact
4. Prioritize against other work
```

### 2. Triage & Assessment (5-15 minutes)

#### Information Gathering
- **Error Details**: Check Sentry for stack traces
- **Scope**: How many users affected?
- **Timeline**: When did issue start?
- **Services**: Which components are impacted?
- **Metrics**: Check performance dashboards

#### Impact Assessment Questions
- How many users are affected?
- Which features are impacted?
- Is data at risk?
- Are payments processing?
- Can users authenticate?

### 3. Investigation & Diagnosis

#### Debug Information Sources
- **Vercel Logs**: Function execution logs
- **Sentry Events**: Error tracking and context
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance, connections
- **Stream Chat Dashboard**: Real-time messaging status
- **Third-party Status Pages**: External service status

#### Common Investigation Steps
```bash
# Check recent deployments
vercel ls --scope=[team]

# Review recent commits
git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago"

# Check error patterns in Sentry
# Review performance metrics in Vercel dashboard
# Verify environment variables in Vercel console
```

### 4. Resolution & Mitigation

#### Quick Fixes
- **Rollback**: If caused by recent deployment
- **Configuration**: Adjust environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Temporarily increase limits if needed
- **Service Restart**: Restart specific services if possible

#### Hotfix Deployment
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/incident-[number]

# Make minimal fix
# Test thoroughly
npm run test
npm run build

# Deploy to preview first
vercel --prod=false

# After validation, deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Communication

#### Internal Communication
- **Engineering Team**: Technical updates in Slack
- **Management**: Status updates every 30 minutes for P1
- **Customer Support**: User-facing messaging guidance

#### External Communication
- **Status Page**: Update if user-visible impact
- **Direct User Communication**: Email if affecting specific users
- **Social Media**: Only for widespread issues

#### Communication Templates
