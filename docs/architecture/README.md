# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Cascais Fishing Platform. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They help track the reasoning behind significant technical choices.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: Situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: Results of the decision, both positive and negative

## Current ADRs

### Core Architecture
- [ADR-001: Email Service Architecture](./ADR-001-email-service-architecture.md)
- [ADR-002: Stream Chat Integration](./ADR-002-stream-chat-integration.md)
- [ADR-003: Security Implementation Strategy](./ADR-003-security-implementation.md)
- [ADR-004: Performance Optimization Approach](./ADR-004-performance-optimization.md)

### Development & Deployment
- [ADR-005: Build System Configuration](./ADR-005-build-system.md)
- [ADR-006: Database Architecture](./ADR-006-database-architecture.md)
- [ADR-007: Authentication Strategy](./ADR-007-authentication-strategy.md)

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Identify the Decision**: Is this decision significant enough to warrant documentation?
2. **Use the Template**: Copy the ADR template
3. **Fill in Context**: Explain the situation and constraints
4. **Document the Decision**: Be clear about what was chosen
5. **List Consequences**: Include both benefits and drawbacks
6. **Update this Index**: Add your ADR to the list above

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context
[Describe the situation and constraints that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the decision that was made and why]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List positive outcomes]

### Negative
- [List negative outcomes]

### Neutral
- [List neutral aspects]

## References
- [Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or resources]
```
