  "summary": "Diagnosed and fixed all module resolution errors preventing Vercel deployment. Root causes identified: (1) Vercel requires explicit .tsx extensions for React components in email service, (2) Implicit index file imports not supported in Vercel build environment. Applied targeted fixes to lib/email-service.ts (added .tsx extensions) and lib/services/email-service.ts (explicit /index path). Local build now passes successfully with all 190 pages generated. Ready for Vercel deployment.",
  "current_status": "All module resolution errors resolved. Local build verification complete. Standing by for deployment authorization."
