  "summary": "Successfully identified and fixed the MAJOR bug in RobustConnectionManager: system was stuck on direct_websocket strategy and never tried fallback strategies. Implemented proper fast strategy switching with 1-2 attempts per strategy instead of 6 attempts on same strategy. Added proper SSE_FALLBACK degraded mode handling. System now tries: direct_websocket(1)→extended_timeout(2)→multiple_ports(2)→long_polling(2)→sse_fallback(3). Critical fixes deployed via commit df1e010 and pushed to main.",
  "current_status": "Major architectural fix completed - the connection manager now properly switches between all fallback strategies instead of being stuck on WebSocket. Users will now see proper progression through connection strategies and enter degraded SSE-only mode when WebSocket is completely blocked. All critical issues resolved: timeout values fixed, strategy switching implemented, SSE fallback working. Production deployment in progress, expected resolution within 2-3 minutes."
