  "summary": "Critical analysis completed: RESTT Plan at 99.9% but significant user-impacting issues remain unresolved. Phase 5 (Weather API) and Phase 6 (API Authorization) completely not started. API Profiles returning HTTP 500 'Failed to fetch profiles' - critical user-facing problem. All 4 test pages (404 in production) diagnosed but solution not implemented. Core user functionality works perfectly, but several important features broken.",
  "current_status": "RESTT Plan success confirmed for core systems (auth, chat, admin) but critical gaps identified: API Profiles HTTP 500 error affects user experience, Weather API configuration missing, API authorization issues unresolved, and test pages deployment problem unsolved. Need focused effort on remaining phases."
