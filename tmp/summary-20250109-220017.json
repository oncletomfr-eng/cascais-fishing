  "summary": "Successfully eliminated ALL P2038 'Missing configured driver adapter' errors through systematic codebase audit and fixes. Identified and corrected 22 files that were using 'new PrismaClient()' without proper PostgreSQL adapter configuration. Implemented comprehensive solution with 3 phases: (1) Critical API services fixes preventing build failures, (2) Application layer fixes for server actions and utilities, (3) Scripts and utilities updates for consistency.

Production deployment ready.",
