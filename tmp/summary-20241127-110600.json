  "summary": "Successfully resolved all build compilation errors that were preventing deployment. Fixed missing default exports for admin components (BookingsTable, AdminProvider, AdminSidebar) and UI components (Badge, Toaster). Resolved duplicate variable declarations in chat API routes that were causing webpack module parse errors. The application now builds successfully locally and has been pushed to trigger a new Vercel deployment. All previous serverless function size optimizations remain in place (dynamic imports, .vercelignore, vercel.json configuration).",
  "current_status": "Deployment is now building with commit 6bb1adb. All compilation errors have been resolved. The build compiles successfully with no webpack errors, component imports are working, and static page generation is proceeding normally. This should result in a successful deployment to production without the previous 300MB serverless function size limit or build compilation issues."
