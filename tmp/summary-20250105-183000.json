  "summary": "ðŸŽ¯ BREAKTHROUGH! Ultra-deep investigation successfully resolved the '/_not-found lambda' routing issue. Root cause identified: missing Next.js App Router special files (not-found.tsx, error.tsx, loading.tsx). Created all required files, local build now shows /_not-found route (664B), and Vercel deployment error changed from routing failure to size limit - confirming the routing fix worked! Problem #1 (routing) âœ… SOLVED, Problem #2 (250MB size) remains but now can be addressed separately.",
  "current_status": "ðŸŽŠ PARTIAL VICTORY - Routing problem completely fixed through systematic investigation and creation of missing App Router files. Vercel no longer complains about missing lambda routes. Current challenge: serverless function size limits (250MB). Architecture needs fundamental changes: microservices split, different platform, or massive endpoint reduction. Ready for next phase of optimization."
