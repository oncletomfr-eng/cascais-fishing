  "summary": "Investigated deployment issues for cascais-fishing project. Found that the Vercel team account has been paused/blocked due to exceeding fair use limits, not billing issues. The site at cascaisfishing.com shows 'deployment temporarily paused' because the team exceeded monthly usage thresholds (likely function execution, data transfer, or build time limits). Recommended three resolution paths: wait for monthly reset, upgrade to Pro plan ($20/month with much higher limits), or contact Vercel support to discuss usage patterns.",
  "current_status": "Deployment blocked due to Vercel fair use limit violations. Root cause identified and resolution options provided. The project builds successfully locally but cannot deploy until limits are addressed. User needs to take action on Vercel account level to resolve the pause status."
