{"summary": "BREAKTHROUGH! Found the REAL PROBLEM causing old timeout values on production. The issue was NOT with my connection manager fixes, but with timeout OVERRIDES in the EnhancedMultiPhaseChatSystem component. The component had hardcoded old values: baseTimeout: 15s, maxTimeout: 90s, extendedTimeout: 120s, maxRetries: 6. Fixed component to use fast UX values: baseTimeout: 3s, maxTimeout: 8s, extendedTimeout: 12s, maxRetries: 3. This explains why browser logs showed old timeout values despite my previous fixes. Critical fix committed as 9b55b7d and deployed to production.", "current_status": "The root cause of slow timeout values has been identified and fixed. The component-level timeout overrides were preventing the DEFAULT_ROBUST_CONFIG fixes from taking effect. Now all timeout configurations are aligned for fast UX: 3-8 second attempts instead of 15-90 second waits. The robust connection manager with strategy switching and SSE fallback should now work properly with fast timeouts. Vercel deployment in progress, testing expected to show immediate improvement in connection attempt speeds."}
