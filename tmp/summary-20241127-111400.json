  "summary": "Identified and resolved the root cause of the persistent deployment failures. The issue was an import/export mismatch: components had default exports but were being imported with named import syntax. Fixed import statements in app/admin/bookings/page.tsx and app/admin/layout.tsx to use default imports instead of destructured named imports. Local build now compiles successfully and changes have been pushed as commit 804f8d3 to trigger a new Vercel deployment.",
  "current_status": "All deployment blockers have been systematically resolved: 1) Serverless function size optimized with dynamic imports and .vercelignore, 2) Build compilation errors fixed with proper import/export matching, 3) Latest deployment should now succeed. The application is ready for production deployment to https://cascais-fishing-git-main-victors-projects-1cb47092.vercel.app"
