  "summary": "üí• DEPLOYMENT FAILURE CONFIRMED: Despite massive optimizations (reducing workspace from 3.4GB to 1.5GB, excluding massive node_modules packages, removing problematic configurations), Vercel deployment still fails with '250MB serverless function size exceeded'. The architecture with 120+ API endpoints is fundamentally incompatible with Vercel's serverless limits. User was correct - no real victory without working deployment.",
  "current_status": "‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE - Vercel deployment impossible with current architecture. Reduced workspace size by 54% but serverless functions still exceed limits. Need fundamental architectural changes: microservices split, different deployment platform, or massive endpoint reduction. Current approach confirmed non-viable for Vercel serverless platform."
