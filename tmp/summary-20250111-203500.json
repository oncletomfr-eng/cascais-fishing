{"summary": "CRITICAL SSE_FALLBACK FIX DEPLOYED! Identified and fixed the major bug where SSE_FALLBACK strategy was still trying to connect to Stream Chat instead of entering degraded mode. The issue was that getClientForStrategy created a real StreamChat client even for SSE_FALLBACK, which then failed connection attempts. Fixed by: 1) Setting client=null in SSE_FALLBACK degraded mode, 2) Removing this.client check that prevented success with null client, 3) Making SSE_FALLBACK return success=true without attempting Stream Chat connection. Deployed via commit 1cb5f82. Expected result: Users will now successfully enter SSE-only degraded mode instead of seeing connection failure after 7 attempts.", "current_status": "The fundamental SSE_FALLBACK bug has been fixed and deployed. The robust connection manager now properly implements all fallback strategies: direct_websocket→extended_timeout→multiple_ports→long_polling→sse_fallback. Each strategy has appropriate timeouts (3-12s) and the final SSE_FALLBACK now correctly enters degraded mode with success=true and client=null, instead of failing. This should resolve the 'Не удалось подключиться к серверу чата' error and show successful SSE-only operation."}
