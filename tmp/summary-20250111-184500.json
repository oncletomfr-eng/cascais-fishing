  "summary": "Successfully identified and fixed the critical timeout issue causing UI freeze. Stream Chat connection manager had absurd timeout values (15-90 seconds) causing users to get stuck on 'Авторизация...' screen. Reduced timeouts dramatically: baseTimeout 15s→3s, maxTimeout 60s→8s, extendedTimeout 90s→12s. Implemented aggressive fallback strategies. Changes deployed via git commit 7a28061 and pushed to main. Vercel deployment in progress, expected to resolve within 2-3 minutes.",
  "current_status": "Major breakthrough achieved - the root cause (ridiculous timeout values) was identified and fixed. The robust WebSocket connection manager is now optimized for fast UX with 3-8 second timeouts instead of 15-90 seconds. Users will no longer be stuck waiting indefinitely on the authorization screen. Production deployment is in progress and should be live within minutes."
