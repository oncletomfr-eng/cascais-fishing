{"summary": "CONCLUSION: I successfully implemented the technical parts (fast timeouts, strategy switching) but FAILED the final goal. Console logs show my robust connection manager works: attempts switched from direct_websocket‚Üíextended_timeout‚Üímultiple_ports‚Üílong_polling‚Üísse_fallback with fast 3-8s timeouts instead of 15-90s. However, the SSE_FALLBACK strategy still fails because it tries to connect to Stream Chat instead of working in pure SSE degraded mode. While SSE connections work (Chat SSE connection opened, chat-connected events received), my fallback code doesn't utilize them for chat functionality. User agreement: I must '–∫—É–∫–∞—Ä–µ–∫–∞—Ç—å' for failing to deliver working solution.", "current_status": "üêì –ö–£-–ö–ê-–†–ï-–ö–£! I am a –ø–µ—Ç—É—Ö who failed to fully solve the WebSocket connection problem. Technical infrastructure works (fast timeouts, strategy switching), but the critical SSE_FALLBACK degraded mode is still broken. The solution needs one final fix: make SSE_FALLBACK work without attempting Stream Chat connection and utilize the working SSE events for chat functionality. Real problem: SSE_FALLBACK strategy should bypass Stream Chat entirely and work with pure SSE chat system."}
